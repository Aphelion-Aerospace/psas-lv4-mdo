    "# Trajectory Simulation\n",
    "At first blush, this will appear to be much more complicated than the trajectory simulation of the original MDO. That is because it is. However, that is just the trade-off we pay for an increase in modularity and flexibility, as well as (I hope) conceptual clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are doing systems engineering, I have imposed a hierarchical organization by making use of sequencing and Python classes.\n",
    "1. There are model parameters at the top (and at the top of *openrocket_interface*) where they are easily accessible in case some basic assumptions change.\n",
    "2. The engine is itself a subsystem at the bottom of the hierarchy, so it is the most general class.\n",
    "    * It only initializes engine-specific variables.\n",
    "        * mdot, p_e, p_ch, T_ch, k_e, R_e\n",
    "    * It contains the thrust function (even though thrust technically depends on ambient pressure at the altitude).\n",
    "3. The rocket is the main system whose class inherits an engine.\n",
    "    * This initializes relevant variables.\n",
    "        * t, alt, v, a, m_prop, m_dry, length, airframe frontal area\n",
    "    * Rocket is concerned only with location, geometry, and mass.\n",
    "4. The physical environment is a supersystem in which the rocket is embedded (i.e. the environment inherits a rocket).\n",
    "    * This determines air characteristics, drag profile (based off .csv either from OpenRocket or an actual Aerobee), and initial thrust (since that depends on initial location).\n",
    "    * This keeps track of the atmosphere, drag, and gravitational force.\n",
    "5. Then there is the trajectory itself and its initialization, as well as the logical and mathematical details of each discrete step of the numerical integration.\n",
    "6. Finally, there is the overall simulation from start to finish, as well as the calculation of variables that are relevant to the optimization. *trajectory* returns the whole simulation as an object rather than a list of variables from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Model\n",
    "* The assumptions in *openrocket_interface* are consistent.\n",
    "* The launch tower is 60' tall.\n",
    "* Actual thrust is 100% of ideal thrust.\n",
    "    * At a later date, we may wish to model inefficiencies.\n",
    "* The nose cone is 1.5 m long.\n",
    "* The ERS and RCS subsystems are 6\" long.\n",
    "* The Avionics and N2 subsystems are 18\" long.\n",
    "* The gaps between those subsystems is negligible. Note that the gaps between subsystems on the lower half of the rocket are included, so perhaps this is a poor assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Engine\n",
    "* The standard equation for thrust isn't garbage.\n",
    "* Accounting for the thrust cosine loss is a good idea.\n",
    "* Thrust goes straight up z axis.\n",
    "* Exit pressure remains constant through-out flight.\n",
    "* We may throttle our mass flow rate up to 60%.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rocket\n",
    "* The airframe can be considered a cylinder to calculate its mass if we pretend it's a little thinner than it is (to account for the nose cone tapering). This assumption could be replaced by some geometry, but it is close enough to OpenRocket to hand-wave.\n",
    "* There is a host of assumptions about the masses of each subsystem. Nothing too crazy though.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "* The drag coefficients with respect to Mach are equivalent to the sample used and provided by OpenRocket for a rocket with the same profile but different length. If you don't like this assumption you are free to assume the drag of an empirical Aerobee-150 is equivalent, but until we get a wind tunnel or good CFD sims, this is fine...ish.\n",
    "* There are some arcane but reasonable assumptions about the thermodynamic properties of dry air and the US 1976 Standard Atmosphere model.\n",
    "* The equation for drag is sane.\n",
    "* The equation for gravity at the latitude/altitude of the launch site is a fine approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trajectory\n",
    "* The average velocity around departing the launch tower is a good enough approximation of the actual velocity at that moment.\n",
    "* The loss of mass as well as the force from expelling N2 for the RCS system is negligible.\n",
    "* Trajectory is 1 dimensional, loss from other 5 degrees of freedom is irrelevant.\n",
    "* Internal steps of Runge-Kutta only need to vary the time, altitude, and velocity. In the python file, there are other functions that vary more of the state variables, but that both takes longer and is more optimistic, so this simple integration is better for our purposes.\n",
    "* Our discretization of the actual physics involved is reasonable."

It should be noted that the $p_e$ is a design variable tied to the expansion ratio of the rocket engine, but that $p_a$ is constantly changing with altitude.

    "To be quite frank, I have not closely examined the consistency of this set of equations, but it apparently worked for the previous MDO, so I've been saving the hand-calc derivations for a rainy day."
