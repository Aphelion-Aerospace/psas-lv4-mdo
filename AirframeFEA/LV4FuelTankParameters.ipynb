    "### Introduction\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to determine the failure criterea of the aluminum or carbon fiber composite fuel tank walls. An Abaqus 6.14 model is developed assuming that the fuel tank is axisymmetric with some simplifications regarding the internals of the fuel tank. An initial model is developed and run, assuming there is no baffling or plumbing within the fuel tank, to ensure the composite definitions are sensible. A more advanced model is then developed using Solidworks as well as Abaqus that includes the internals expected to be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Internals:**\n",
    "- Fuel line\n",
    "- Baffling fins\n",
    "- Baffling net\n",
    "- Transition region ribbing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Propellant:**\n",
    "- **Fuel:** Isopropyl, 70%\n",
    "- **Oxidizer:** Liquid Oxygen\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theory\n",
    "For the propellant, the oxidizer to fuel ratio $OF$ is set as &1.3&, leading to the following expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{m_{ox}}{m_{f}}=OF=1.3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the mass of the propellant defined by the [LV4 Design Optimization](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-analysis/blob/master/optimization/LV4_Optimization.ipynb), the required volume for each of the sections is defined by the following set of expressions, assuming both the fuel and oxidizer tanks have the same hemishperical endcaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m_{p}=m_{ox}+m_{f}$$\n",
    "$$V_{ox} = \\rho_{ox} m_{ox} = 2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi\\right)\\left(R_{o}-t\\right)^3 + \\pi L_{ox} \\left(R_{o}-t\\right)^2$$\n",
    "$$V_{f} = \\rho_{f} m_{f} = 2 \\left(\\frac{4}{3} \\pi\\right)\\left(R_{o}-t\\right)^3 + \\pi L_{f} \\left(R_{o}-t\\right)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal with using these definitions is to drive the cylindrical tank portion lengths $L_{ox}$ and $L_{f}$ using the ratio $OF=1.3$ and known propellant densities $\\rho_{ox}$ and $\\rho_{f}$. Rearranging to solve for the tank lengths leads to the following expressions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{ox}(t)=\\frac{\\rho_{ox} \\left(m_{p}-\\frac{m_{p}}{1+OF}\\right)}{\\pi (R_{o}-t)^2}-2 \\frac{4}{3}(R_{o}-t)$$\n",
    "$$L_{f}(t)=\\frac{\\rho_{ox} \\left(\\frac{m_{p}}{1+OF}\\right)}{\\pi (R_{o}-t)^2}-2 \\frac{4}{3}(R_{o}-t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "With the lengths of the cylindrical portions defined as functions of the wall thickness, the next step is to determine the wall minimum thickness with a factor of safety. To do this, the properties of the material are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Material | Failure Criteria |\n",
    "| -------- | ---------------- |\n",
    "| Ductile  | Von Mises        |\n",
    "| Brittle  | Mohr's Theory    |\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\frac{(\\sigma_{1}-\\sigma_{2})^2 + (\\sigma_{2}-\\sigma_{3})^2 + (\\sigma_{3}-\\sigma_{1})^2}{2}} \\le \\sigma_{y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assumptions\n",
    "To perform this analysis using composite or aluminum, the pressure vessel is assumed to be thin-walled. To apply this assumption the wall thickness $t$ must be much smaller than a characteristic dimension $R$, in this case the tank radius $r$.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{R}{t}>10$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplifed pressure vessel is assumed to be axisymmetric, and the advanced model vessel is assumed to by symmetric about both the $x,z$ and $y,z$ planes. To simplify manufacturing and design, both the oxidizer and fuel tanks are the same material, wall thickness, radius, and have the same hemispherical endcaps. One of the tanks will have a fuel line running through the center, while the other tank will only have an opening for that specific fuel line at the bottom."
