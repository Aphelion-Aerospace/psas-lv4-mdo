    "## Fuel Tank FEA Analysis\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to determine the failure criterea of the carbon fiber composite fuel tank walls. An Abaqus 6.14 model is developed assuming that the fuel tank is axisymmetric with some simplifications regarding the internals of the fuel tank. An initial model is developed and run, assuming there is no baffling or plumbing within the fuel tank, to ensure the composite definitions are sensible. A more advanced model is then developed that includes the internals expected to be present.\n",
    "## Assumptions and Theory\n",
    "To perform this analysis using a layered composite, the pressure vessel is assumed to be thin-walled. To apply this assumption, the wall thickness $t$ must be much smaller than a characteristic dimension $R$, in this case the vessel radius $r$. \n",
    "\\begin{equation} \\label{eq1}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\n",
    "\\frac{t}{r} << 1\n",
    "\\end{split}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "The simplifed pressure vessel is assumed to be axisymmetric, and the advanced model vessel is assumed to by symmetric about both the $x,z$ and $y,z$ planes."
