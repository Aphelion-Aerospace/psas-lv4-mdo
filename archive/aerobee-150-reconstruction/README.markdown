# Aerobee 150

The Aerobee 150 vehicle was a two-stage, liquid-engine propelled, fin
stabilized, free-flight (unguided) rocket. It was boosted from a launch tower
by a short burn solid motor booster. The main rocket was a pressure fed design
consisting of ANFA fuel and IRNFA oxidiser with approximately a 52 second burn
time<sup>1</sup>.

Our interest in researching this vehicle is in model verification. The
Aerobee 150 is a relatively small sounding rocket with a very simple liquid
engine. Although it is about 10 times bigger than the system we would like to
build, it should serve as a good analog. More importantly there exists ample
data, both the design phase and from actual flights.
