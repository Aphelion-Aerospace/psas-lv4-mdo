If the optimizer steps outside of the apogee window, the barrier functions can attempt undefined operations (specifically, taking the logarithm of a negative number), so some error handling is required to return an infinite value in those cases. Provided that the initial design is within the feasible region, the optimizer will not become disoriented by infinite values."
