    "# Parametric Liquid Engine Maker for OpenRocket\n",
    "This is adapted from a script created by natronics, 7deeptide, and jalouke to create engine files for OpenRocket. Its original purpose was to determine some crucial properties of the engine system based on initial assumptions and specifications a few years before the multidisciplinary design optimization for LV4 began.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has since been reformed to take its parameters from the MDO model in order to utilize OpenRocket as a downstream verifier of potential designs. It should be noted that OpenRocket was not made with high-powered rockets in mind, and so one should not be too surprised if the final apogee differs between OpenRocket and our trajectory model by as much as 20 km. Also, the OpenRocket rocket template is currently a revision behind our canonical design and still needs to be updated to match the latest CAD and structural model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, this script creates an OpenRocket engine file, which is a black box with a time-dependant thrust curve and which accounts for its own mass properties and center of mass. This script also takes a template for a rocket and changes a few parameters to match the given model, then saves this as a new OpenRocket rocket file."

    "Our optimization will spit out a list of relevant details, which is passed to this function so we can save everything potentially useful in one nice way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our rocket template is an xml file set to use one node to determine the diameter of each subsystem so we just have to climb that tree to change out the airframe radius and the two tank lengths and viola! Note, this effects just the rocket file, it is the next function that creates the engine file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is probably a nice way to use the imported XML library instead of manually inserting text, but I don't quite care enough since it's perfectly functional. This takes its parameters straight from the trajectory simulation of an optimized rocket. It doesn't do anything particularly exciting, just creates a thrust curve and calculates some odds and ends that OpenRocket likes. It's unfortunate that thrust in OpenRocket doesn't account for altitude, but the discrepancy in final apogee is usually no more than 2 or 3 km (our trajectory simulation seems to be conservative).\n",
