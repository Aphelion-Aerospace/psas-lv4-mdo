    "## Abstract\n",
    "This is a program for generating an optimized rocket design based on a feasible initial design, some fixed parameters, physical constants, and a theoretical rocket model. Mass is minimized while satisfying a number of mission constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "A feasible design is successfully produced and analyzed, as well as a model of it that is compatible with OpenRocket simulation. This provides a centralized source of authoritative information on the design of Portland State Aerospace Society's 4th launch vehicle design, LV4.\n",
    "\n",
    "These programs were adapted by Cory from the work done by Ondrej, Erin, and Ian on the original MDO.\n",
    "\n",
    "This depends on several other programs, located in the same directory. They should be consulted, as they contain details which are omitted here.\n",

    "    * defines some useful functions\n",
    "    * defines all constants and parameters,\n",

    "\n",
    "## Standard Operating Procedure\n",
    "0. RTFM.\n",
    "1. Review assumptions of supporting notebooks.\n",
    "2. Make appropriate modifications (if any) to parameters in **System_Definition** and set initial design variables there.\n",
    "    * Note, garbage in, garbage out applies. If the initial design is infeasible, the optimization will abort.\n",
    "3. Run all the code blocks in this notebook in sequential order.\n",
    "4. Wait patiently for the algorithm to converge, perhaps a couple hours, depending on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "The equations of motion for a rocket, a variable-mass system, are highly non-linear and there are no closed-form analytic solutions. Additionally, launch vehicles are complex systems with multiple interactions and mutual dependencies between their subsystems, each of which in and of itself constitute a difficult engineering project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This presents a difficulty for clean-sheet design of a launch vehicle to fulfill specific mission requirements. A sufficiently detailed model and numerical integration techniques can be used to circumvent mathematical challenges to evaluating a given rocket design, at the cost of increased computational resources. A well-posed optimization problem and an algorithm implentating it can be used to capture constraints and requirements, to allow a feasible and locally optimal solution to emerge naturally from system dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other approaches to rocket design, such as trade space analysis or design of experiments. We have chosen our approach because it allows us to optimize the whole system all at once, hopefully cutting down on the time and effort that would be spent keeping the system consistent while developing only chunks of it at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "We may construct an *objective function* that represents the quality of our rocket as we see it. We selected Gross Liftoff Weight (**GLOW**) as our primary figure of merit, since it incorporates many aspects of a mission profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Tsiolkovsky rocket equation $$\\frac{\\Delta v}{v_e} = \\ln\\left(\\frac{m_0}{m_f}\\right)$$ can be rearranged to isolate GLOW, $m_0$. The structure of the rocket and its subsystems determine its final dry mass, $m_f$; the effective exhaust velocity, $v_e$, captures engine performance; and the total change in velocity, $\\delta v$, is determined by mission objectives, and can potentially include estimates of gravitational and atmospheric losses. So, minimizing GLOW while demanding a certain apogee is equivalent to simultaneously minimizing structural mass, maximizing engine performance, and balancing the conflicting goals of minimizing losses due to gravity and aerodynamics. Note that the sources of this conflict are the incentive to expel propellant rapidly to avoid the cost of carrying propellant in a gravitational field and the incentive to reduce velocity in lower atmosphere since drag is proportional to air pressure and the square of velocity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In additional to this high-level objective, there are also several requirements and constraints that a given design must fulfill for a successful mission. These will be detailed in a following section. To represent them, we may use a series of *barrier* and *penalty functions* which bound potential rockets to a feasible region in the design space. A barrier function provides an absolute constraint that can not be violated under any circumstance, while a penalty function only disincentives designs if they stray far from a more permeable set of constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adding our three types of functions together, we obtain a *merit function* to minimize which encapsulates all of our relevant considerations as a positive real number. The input to our merit function is simply an array of values that are sufficient to determine our mathematical model of a rocket and its performance. However, each evaluation of the function entails that a simulation of the rocket's trajectory be computed, so the merit function itself does not admit to differentiation or finite differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to approach this issue, two of which are covered in this program. If the design space is between 2 and 4 dimensions (inclusive), we may use the Nelder-Mead simplex method, a directed search that doesn't use derivatives. Note that a simplex is just a triangle generalized to n-dimensions. Performance of this geometry-based algorithm degrades as dimensionality increases, facilitating it becoming stuck in a local minimum. Another option is to use a genetic algorithm to seek a global optimum stochastically, which is much more computationally expensive but not restricted to low-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theoretically, there are other methods possible, such as constructing and optimizing on a response surface model that is itself only a calculus-and-statistics-friendly model of our simulation model. We could also do Monte-Carlo simulation or some other stochastic optimization method, or even some sort of Latin Square trade-analysis. However, our results using both of the methods we selected closely agree and have been satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we deviate significantly from [the previous MDO](https://github.com/psas/liquid-engine-analysis/blob/master/archive/LV4_Optimization.ipynb) is in our decision to do an iterative sequence of Nelder-Mead optimizations instead of just one. Before the penalty, and barrier functions are added to the objective function, they are weighed by user-selected parameters. Balancing these weights is an art; if they are too low, the optimizer can ignore or even abuse them, and if they are too high, the optimizer can neglect the objective and rapidly spiral into a somewhat artificial local minimum. Rather than picking arbitrary values that seem to give us the results we want, now we begin with very low weights, and for each successive optimization, we increase them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ought to enable more global coverage initially, while restricting the optimizer's freedom of movement in the design space after it has had a chance to find a satisfactory neighborhood. Since the weights become astronomically high, this also gives us a trivial method for determining whether we have articulated a well-posed problem and produced a strictly feasible design, or asked an unsatisfiable problem and received only the closest to being feasible design in a region of even worse alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if a genetic algorithm is performed instead, an arbitrary weight must be selected intelligently, since a sequence of such optimization problems is exceedingly impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "We technically may not speak of \"convergence\", since it is possible for the Nelder-Mead method to stagnate on non-stationary points if the geometry of the simplex becomes ill-conditioned. However, since we are doing a sequence of optimizations, the simplex geometry is reset each time, so this is likely to not be an issue. The results have been in the same neighborhood as solutions given by a genetic algorithm, so our global coverage of the feasible region of the design space seems satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "* If an optimization iteration returns a vector within $10^{-6}$ of the last iteration, there is no point in going further.\n",
    "* Our initial design vector is already feasible (garbage in, garbage out).\n",
    "* A 12\" diameter is a reasonable stipulation.\n",
    "    * If this is much wider, then drag becomes horrible, if this is much thinner, then the L/D ratio becomes unreasonable. The standing assumption was already that LV4 would be 12\", so we made this a fixed parameter instead of a design variable, in part for conceptual simplicity for members of our organization.\n",
    "    * Our optimization algorithm also performs poorly in high-dimensional spaces, so this should protect us from the curse of dimensionality. It is trivial to make it a design variable again, but we are moving forward as is.\n",
    "* Our constraints are reasonable and satisfiable. \n",
    "* SciPy's implementations of the Nelder-Mead and genetic algorithm methods are sufficient for our purposes."

    "Then, we have detailed information from the trajectory of our optimal rocket design. Note that there are some low-level details suppressed here, but contained in the saved text file.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a plot of that trajectory and some of the state variables we care about, which can be enlightening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are three projections of the optimization path in the design space, as well as its 3D representation. This informs a sense of how an initial design is improved by the optimizer, and how design variables relate to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next visualization is of our design variables normalized as a percentage of their optimal values. This reduces the entire optimization into one easily comprehendable image. Note that spikes occur where iterations begin, since the Nelder-Mead method is reinitialized and must relearn how far it can move in any direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a semi-log plot of the merit values of our sequence of designs. The spikes are again from the beginning of iterations. If our problem is well-posed, punishment for deviation from feasibility will exponentially increase with each iteration and the minimum of each iteration will be decreasing. An ill-conditioned problem will have an increasing minimum with each iteration, since there would be no feasible design and the punishments would be growing. In either case, gaps appear in the plot where a design failed to satisfy the apogee window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "*Prima facie*, this program produces viable rocket designs. The next step is to experiment with in OpenRocket with the model produced. It is critical that we make sure the stability requirement set by Base-11 is met (calibers > 2 throughout flight), and it is also an opportunity to experiment with different masses and fins, as well as environmental conditions such as wind or launching at 85 degrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sequence of merit evaluations is bounded below by 0 but is not bounded above, since some designs have infinite values. Provided that the problem is well-conditioned, the subsequence of minimums from each iteration is monotonically decreasing. So, it seems reasonable to infer that an ideal optimal rocket design exists for a well-posed problem. This program approximates that ideal design, but whether it is a good approximation might be a qualitative judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other design and optimization methods, and different choices that could have been made. This code is fairly flexible so it isn't too difficult to change assumptions on the fly. The goal is not to provide a definitive final design of a rocket; rather it is to provide a design tool which will be useful throughout the design, manufacturing, and testing processes of LV4, up to and including the day it launches.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that the difference between design parameters and variables is largely stipulative. With slight effort, some parameters could be freed for optimization and some variables could be frozen. The chamber pressure has been stipulated and determines the thermodynamic properties that made us select the oxygen/fuel ratio we stipulate. There is another script in this repository that can be used to perform a trade-space analysis of chamber pressure and propellant configurations, if we decide to revisit those preliminary assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have been conservative in our mass estimates in order to perform a more robust optimization. We could also take the maximum merit evaluation in the neighborborhood of a given design, as bounded by engineering tolerances, instead of simply evaluating a single design. That would obviously be computationally costly, but each neighborhood could be evaluated by parallel distributed processes, and the benefit of implementing a minmax problem instead of a minimization problem could be worth it, considering the inevitable inefficiencies that may arise in a physical system.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be a good idea to do some statistical analysis of the design space to produce a heat map as well, so we could characterize the topology of our design space. It's possible that there may be multiple optimal neighborhoods, and this would answer that question. Note that a sensitivity analysis of the current optimization program could also answer that question, by probing the design space with different initial designs."
