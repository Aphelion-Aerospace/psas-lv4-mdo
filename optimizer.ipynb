    "# Multi-Disciplinary Design Optimization\n",
    "## Abstract\n",
    "This is a program for generating an optimized rocket based on a feasible initial design and some fixed parameters. It depends on two subprograms, *trajectory* (which models a rocket based on the design variables, and simulates its trajectory) and *openrocket_interface* (which models an engine based on the design variables and simulation, and generates an OpenRocket model and corresponding engine for further testing). This program uses the Nelder-Mead simplex method to minimize mass while satisfying a number of mission constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "## User Requirements\n",
    "* Patience\n",
    "* 'optimization' directory from Cory's branch of the liquid-engine-analysis repo\n",
    "* OpenRocket\n",
    "    * This depends on Java 8\n",
    "    * Technically, mostly everything will work fine without OR, but it will get confused at the very end if it tries to put the engine file in a directory that doesn't exist. If you manually create the folder, it will be fine.\n",
    "* Python3\n",
    "* Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "* Scipy\n",
    "* Numpy\n",
    "* Matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "## Standard Operating Procedure\n",
    "1. Review assumptions of *openrocket_interface* and make appropriate modifications (if any) to parameters at the beginning of that code. Save if you do.\n",
    "2. Review assumptions of *trajectory* and make appropriate modifications (if any) to parameters at the beginning of that code. Save if you do.\n",
    "3. Review assumptions of *optimizer* and make appropriate modifications (if any) to parameters at the beginning of this code.\n",
    "4. Set initial design variables.\n",
    "    * Note, garbage in, garbage out applies. If you start with a design that ends outside of the altitude window, you will waste 20 minutes of your life.\n",
    "    * I would recommend running *trajectory* with your design first to make sure its final altitude is within the constraints. That is the only necessary condition.\n",
    "5. Run all the code blocks in this notebook in sequential order!\n",
    "6. Go run errands, and there will be a nice surprise waiting for you when you get back.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Rocket science is incredibly difficult and PSAS is holding my family hostage in the basement of the Engineering building (just kidding, rocket science is easy!).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is an infinite number of possible rockets, but only a (still infinite) subset of those are both buildable by PSAS and feasible for achieving the Base-11 mission. However, only a finite sequence of designs of those rockets will be seen by human eyes, the last of which will (hopefully) correspond closely with the one and only rocket that is actually built and which (hopefully) successfully completes its mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "Enter math.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method\n",
    "We may construct an objective function that represents the quality of our rocket. We use Gross Liftoff Weight (GLOW) to determine this, since dry mass is our greatest enemy and propellant mass is our most fickle frenemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We may use a series of penalty and barrier functions to represent the constraints of our mission. These will be detailed in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, this gives us a merit function to minimize. Because our problem is (mathematically speaking) terrible as a result of a simulation standing between design vectors and the variables of our merit function, we use the Nelder-Mead method, a directed search that doesn't use derivatives. Theoretically, there are other methods possible, such as estimating derivatives by finite differences for gradient-based methods, or constructing and optimizing on a response surface model that is itself only a calculus-and-statistics-friendly model of our simulation model. We could also do a genetic algorithm or Monte-Carlo simulation, or some other stochastic optimization method, or even some sort of Latin Square trade-analysis. However, I hate all these options because I don't understand them yet and the previous MDO used the Nelder-Mead method too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Where we deviate significantly from the previous MDO is in our decision to do an iterative sequence of optimization problems instead of just one. There was a good reason for this that I can't remember how to articulate properly, so I will come back and explain later. Also, the previous optimizer just returned the least garbage rocket it found based on unsatisfiable constraints (TWR > 8, the main culprit), while now we demand a strictly feasible rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We technically may not speak of \"convergence\", since it is possible for the Nelder-Mead method to stagnate on non-stationary points as the geometry of a simplex becomes ill-conditioned. However, since we are doing a sequence of optimizations, I'm not too concerned since the geometry is reset for each one. I suspect that we converge to at least the neighborhood of a local minimum, but not having seen a heatmap of the design space, I hesitate to say anything besides that we find feasible rockets. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "* If an optimization iteration returns a vector within $10^{-6}$ of the last iteration, there is no point in going further.\n",
    "* A simulation time-step of 0.25 s is good enough but not too good.\n",
    "* 25 iterations is a reasonable maximum number to perform.\n",
    "* The launch site has an altitude of 1401 m (this is true).\n",
    "* Our initial design vector is already feasible (garbage in, garbage out).\n",
    "* A 12\" diameter is a reasonable stipulation.\n",
    "    * If this is wider, then drag becomes horrible, if this is thinner, then the L/D ratio becomes unreasonable. The standing assumption was already that LV4 would be 12\", so I made this a fixed parameter instead of a design variable. Hopefully this protects us from the curse of dimensionality, at least a little.\n",
    "    * Our optimization algorithm also performs poorly in high-dimensional spaces, so this is somewhat of a reasonable assumption. It would be trivial to make it a design variable again, but we are moving forward as is.\n",
    "* Our constraints are reasonable. \n",
    "    * I changed the max L/D ratio from 15 to 18 and reduced the min T/W ratio from 8 to 2 because otherwise there are no feasible designs.\n",
    "    * I added a constraint for launch speed as a stand in for aerodynamic stability and I added a constraint for thrust since we are now stipulating the thrust of the rocket.\n",
    "    * I increased the minimum altitude to account for launch site altitude and to give us room for inefficiency, and added a maximum altitude to conform to Base-11 requirements (as well as to ensure our merit function remains above 0).\n",
    "* Our merit function is numerically well-conditioned.\n",
    "* A sequence of optimization problems is better than a single optimization.\n",
    "* The Nelder-Mead method (specifically SciPy's implementation) is ideal to be using."

    "Above, we can see the details of each iteration of the optimization sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we have the read-out of the latest and greatest rocket. Note that the relevant low-level details from *openrocket_interface* are in the text file saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice plot of our final trajectory and some of the state variables we may care about, which can be enlightening.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then there are three projections of the optimization path as well as its 3D visualization. I find this extremely informative for getting a sense of how an initial design is improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next cool visualization is of our design variables normalized by the eventual optimum. This is cool to see how vectors move closer to where they settle. Note that spikes occur where iterations begin, since the Nelder-Mead method flails wildly until it knows how far it can move.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a plot of the merit functions of our entire sequence of rockets. The spikes are again from the beginning of iterations. This is what we want to see, the punishment for deviation from feasibility is exponentially increasing with each iteration, but the minimum of each iteration is decreasing. That means our problem is well-conditioned. An ill-conditioned problem would have an increasing minimum with each iteration, since there would be no feasible design. Note this graph is semilog, because it's prettier that way. Gaps appear where a rocket ended outside of the altitude window.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion and Next Steps\n",
    "Clearly, our rocket design is viable. Experimenting with it in OpenRocket is a good idea, to make sure the stability requirement set by Base-11 is met (calibers > 2 throughout flight), as well as to experiment with different masses and fins, as well as environmental conditions such as wind or pointing 85 degrees up. Is it optimal? I'm not allowed to say. Is it even the limit of an infinite sequence? I'm not allowed to say.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our sequence of merit evaluations is bounded below clearly (such as by 0) but is not bounded above, since some rockets shoot to infinity. However, provided that the problem is well-conditioned, the subsequence of minimums from each iteration, taken as a set, is bounded above and eventually monotonically decreasing. So, it seems reasonable to infer that an ideal optimal rocket does exist, even though we don't know anything about it. This script approximates that theoretical rocket, whether it is a good approximation might be a qualitative judgement. There are other methods, and different choices that could have been made. I have endeavored to write code that is flexible enough to swap assumptions on the fly, so hopefully this is useful and continues to be so throughout at least the design process of LV4.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to remember that the difference between design constants and variables is stipulative. We could easily fix *p_e* and/or make *D* a variable again. The chamber pressure has been stipulated and determines the thermodynamic properties that made us select the oxygen/fuel ratio we stipulate. It may be a good idea to have a chemistry major write a side script that generalizes *OF* as an optimized function of chamber pressure so we are not locked into these specific values.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may also be a good idea to generalize *dry_mass* to include the possibility for subsystems being overweight similarly to the capability built into *thrust*. We could also take the maximum merit evaluation of a sample of rockets in the neighborborhood of a given design inside of each minimization. Those together could allow us to do a robust optimization (minmax problem) where we search for a rocket that isn't too sensitive to the inevitable engineering flaws that reality entails. That would obviously take a lot of computation time, but the neighborhood could be evaluated in parallel.\n",
