    "# Multidisciplinary Design Optimization of LV4\n",
    "## Motivation\n",
    "Clean-sheet conceptual design and trajectory optimization of launch vehicles is a classically difficult problem. This problem arises for two reasons. The first is that the trajectory equation is a 2nd order non-linear ordinary differential equation with coefficients that are themselves described by non-linear first and second order ODE's. This problem has no closed-form solution. Secondly, detailed design choices in propulsion, structures/weights, aerodynamics, and guidance and control which ultimately all appear as variables in the governing equation are both highly coupled and are non-hierarchical. Schematically the coupling between the variables is presented in the figure below. The traditional approach to dealing with this problem has been to evaluate vehicle performance by examining the value of each parameter by fixing the values of the remaining parameters e.g. by using \"one variable-at-a-time\" trade-off analysis. However there are several key limitations to this approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some relationships among the design variables are poorly understood\n",
    "* Conceptual design is usually carried out with low-fidelity models\n",
    "* Optimizing individual design variables does not guarantee optimality at the overall system level\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice this results in a highly iterative design process and concomitant requirement mismatches, developmental dead-ends, and sub-optimal final design. The problem with sub-optimal design is magnified by the ramifications of Konstantin Tsiolkovsy's equation, with its severe implication of exponential growth in design requirements for linear increases in rocket dry mass. Since ultimately all design decisions impact the rocket dry mass in some way it is imperative to understand these trade-offs and compromises as early in the design process as possible to reduce the potential for technical, schedule, and cost risks. This is especially the case for time, technical expertise, and funding constrained student organizations. Thus there is a strong motivation to treat the conceptual design parameters \"all-at-once\" using applied convex optimization techniques. A numerical design optimization approach allows us to systematically explore this extremely large trade space under a realistic project timeframe and budget."

    "## Methods\n",
    "The objective of the optimization is to minimize the total system complexity and cost of the 100 km launch vehicle. While these objectives can be abstract as numerical values in the early conceptual design phase, we expect them to scale closely with the initial mass of the launch vehicle (including the mass of loaded propellants), which is usually defined by the Gross Lift-Off Weight (GLOW) figure of merit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus we wish to minimize GLOW subject to practical model linearity and structural constraints. In the most practically usefully sense the design variables include thrust, airframe diameter and propellant tank lengths. However for numerical simplicity thrust will be expanded into mass flow rate and expansion ratio design variables, and then back-solved within the simulation. There are also a large number of design constants present in the models, which include specific impulse and combustion chamber pressure, propellant mixture ratio, and others, but which for the sake of brevity will be largely ignored in the following discussion. The model currently includes 6 inequality constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apogee: The maximum altitude on the trajectory\n",
    "* Thrust-to-Weight Ratio (TWR): Trade-off between gravity loss and aerodynamic stability\n",
    "* Length to Diameter Ratio(L/D): Trade-off between aerodynamic stability and mechanical (non-rigid body) resonance modes\n",
    "* Maximum acceleration: Set by the material limits of various launch vehicle subsystems\n",
    "* Diameter: Manufacturability (current process scale-able from \\diameter6\" to up to \\diameter14\") \n",

    "### Trajectory model\n",
    "The trajectory of the rocket, in a single degree of freedom, can be best described by altitude $h(t)$, velocity $V(t)$, and total mass $m(t)$ state variables which are functions of time. The initial values of the state variables are given by $h_0$, $V_0$, and $m_0$ respectively. The governing equation of the rocket trajectory is Newton's 2nd law of motion \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We usually express drag as\n",
    "$$F_d = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho V^2 C_d A$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\rho$ is the local air density, $A$ is the frontal area, $C_d$ is the drag coefficient which for a given airframe geometry is a function of angle-of-attack (which for a 1-DoF system is identically zero), and Mach number. The Mach number is a function given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{V}{c} = \\frac{V}{\\sqrt{kRT}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $c$ is the local speed of sound, $k$ is the gas ratio of specific heats, $R$ is the specific gas constant (assumed constant in altitude), and $T$ is the gas temperature. These numbers, as well as $\\rho$, and $p_a$ the ambient pressure, are supplied by the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere model. For simplicity, drag coefficients are interpolated from published aerodynamic data from the 1950's era NACA/USN/NASA Aerobee-150 sounding rocket\\cite{aerobee}, which is expected to be dimensionally similar (though not identical to) to the LV4 sounding rocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rocket thrust force, given a huge number of simplifying assumptions, is a function of the mass flow rate design variable, the chamber pressure constant, and the ambient pressure state variable. It is given by\n",
    "$$F_t = \\dot{m}V_e + A_e(p_e - p_a) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V_e$ is the rocket exhaust velocity, $A_e$ is the rocket nozzle exit area. The exhaust velocity, again given a large number of simplifying assumptions, is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V_e = \\sqrt{\\frac{2kRT_{ch}}{k - 1}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{p_e}{p_{ch}}\\right)^{((k - 1)/k)}\\right)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T_{ch}$ is the chamber pressure, which along with the combustion chamber gas ratio of specific heats $k$, and gas constant $R$ are functions of the mixture ratio of the propellants, and the chamber pressure $p_{ch}$ determined using the NASA Chemical Equilibrium Analysis (CEA)\\cite{CEA} tool and are design constants. It should be noted that the $p_e$ is a design variable tied to the expansion ratio of the rocket engine, but that $p_a$ is constantly changing with altitude. The thrust function is maximized when $p_e = p_a$, however this occurs at one, and only one, altitude. Thus the design expansion ratio selection directly benefits from trajectory optimization.\n",
    "\n",
    "By finite-differencing the derivatives of the governing equation a first-order Runge-Kutta (e.g. Forward Euler) integration of the governing equation is used to determine the rocket trajectory. This approach was chosen only for simplicity; in principle central differencing or trapezoidal integration are more generally accurate discretization approaches. Forward Euler difference equations always have the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_{i+1} = y_i + \\left(y\\hspace{-1 mm}-\\hspace{-1 mm}\\mbox{rate at } t_i \\right)(t_{i+1} - t_i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y(t)$ is the state variable being integrated, and $i$ is the time index superscript. In this way the state variables $h$, $V$, and $m$ can be defined at any discrete time $t_0$, $t_1$, $t_2$ ... $t_i$. Given a vector of the four design variables the trajectory function returns numerical values of the objective function and constraint vector. This trajectory code was benchmarked against known trajectory and design data for the Aerobee-150 (sustainer only), and Armadillo Stig-B sounding rockets, and the results compare favorably. This grants us at least some confidence in the assumptions made in the model"

    "There are several general approaches to design optimization for launch vehicle design found in literature:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Design of Experiments methods (Taguchi Methods`[1]`, Response Surface Methods`[2]`)\n",
    "* Gradient methods (steepest descent)\n",
    "* Stochastic methods (genetic algorithm`[3]`, simulated annealing)\n",
    "\n",
    "While there are certain advantages to each of these approaches, I only have experience with gradient based methods for the most part. Furthermore the difficulty of differentiating the governing equations, the expected multi-modal nature of the response surface and the discrete nature of some of the variables ($m$, $C_d$, etc.) argue against gradient based methods. We therefore use a gradient free, non-stochastic approach: the Nelder-Mead method (e.g. Simplex Search). The limitations of this choice may become evident for high-dimension problems, but for $x \\in \\textbf{R}^4$, we expect the algorithm to have no major problems with convergence. Inequality constraints were handled by using an exterior penalty function. To desensitize the results to arbitrary values of numerically large constraints the pseudo-objective function has been non-dimensionalized."

    "## Discussion of Preliminary Results\n",
    "As we would expect using Nelder-Mead, the optimized design vector is quite sensitive to the initial guesses. The results appear to always be \"feasible\" designs, however they are often hugging nearly all of the constraints at once. We can attempt to find a more global optima by brute forcing a large array of initial guesses, perhaps using Montecarlo methods, and examining the frequency spectrum to get a sense of the modality of the response surface. Otherwise it may make sense to move to an alternate optimization scheme and avoid Nelder-Mead altogeather e.g. by using a Stochastic method.\n",
    "\n",
    "By changing values in the `dry_mass` function we can see that there is an enormous sensitivty of GLOW to tank mass and inert dry mass, as we would have expected. It is also worthy of note that our optimized designs usually yeild a GLOW of less than 200 kg and total impulse of less than 300 kN s, which would surely make LV4 the smallest ever suborbital rocket to use liquid bi-propellant propulsion. This is a direct result of using our extremely lightweight composite modules as propellant tanks. While increasing the chamber pressure to 500 psi only increases performance by about 10% or so (by various metrics), the real advantage of the electric feed system project is that we get more pressure margin for regenerative cooling with simultaneously buying down risk on the composite propellant tanks (which now might only require 2-3 bar ullage pressurization vs. 20 or so), though this obviously depends on how much dry mass is added by the motors, centrifugal impellers, volutes, batteries and power conditioning system (likely a 100+ V DC bus). Another obvious takeaway is in the TWR constraint. At TWR of 2, LV4 will have $<0$ caliber stability margin off the launch rail. This has the advantage of drastically reducing our propulsion requirements. The significant downside is that full 6-DoF attitude control is now a critical path tech requirement (this would need to be achieved using thrust vanes or by engine gimballing).\n",

    "At present there are some substantial implied limitations to the model as a useful design tool for LV4. The dry mass is based on some very rough estimations, and the optimization results are very sensitive to it. I've tried to deal with this by being conservative in my estimates. The tank mass model is probably optimistic in the sense that it uses a scalar multiple (1.5x) of the current LV3 carbon fiber planar density, plus some allowances for the machine endcaps as a guide to LV4 tank weights. It also does not take into account ullage volume and other neccessary wasted space that nonetheless have the effect of increasing the overall tank mass. We presently do not know if the LV3 CF technology will work as supposed as a pressure vessel in the LV4 diamaters, post-hoc FEA  (and probably some empirical work) is needed to verify this assumption. Another issues is in the drag coeficients used in the drag model. These presently use historical data from the Aerobee-150 sustainer stage. While this may work as a first approximation, it is likely a significant source of error. This can be remedied by using a substantially more complex aerodynamics model in this simulation (perhaps using Barrowmans method) or otherwise post-hoc analysis in Star-CCM+ or another CFD program. The drag coefficients are expected to be largely functions of the fin geometry, which itself depends on static stability analysis. Thus despite a working optimization scheme some recursive analyisis is still required (though vastly less than we might otherwise be forced to do)."
