Run optimizer.py (I use python3) to do what you want to do
Trajectory.py and openrocket_interface.py are utilities it uses. The LV4_Optimization notebook is essential reading for background info and conceptual explanation, my code follows directly from it and some other work that the previous group had done in a different directory of this repo.

Openrocket only works on Java 8 and below. Check out the readme in rocket_farm.
