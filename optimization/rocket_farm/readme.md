This is where rockets will go after program optimizes and creates them.

psas_rocket.ork is the template for future rockets, make changes in it to make changes to future rockets.

The rockets are ordered in sequence, and there are engine files in ~/.openrocket/ThrustCurves/ that correspond numerically.

Just select the corresponding engine when loading rocket in openrocket, and restart openrocket to load new engines. Make sure you adjust ballast weight in nose cone and fin size/shape for stability > 2 throughout flight.
