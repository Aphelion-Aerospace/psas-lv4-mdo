This is where rockets will go after our program optimizes and creates them.

psas_rocket.ork is the template for future rockets, make changes in it to make changes to future rockets.

The rockets are ordered in sequence, and there are engine files in ~/.openrocket/ThrustCurves/ that correspond numerically.

Just restart openrocket to load new engines, then select the corresponding engine when opening rocket in openrocket. Make sure you adjust ballast weight in nosecone and fin size/shape to maintain stability > 2 throughout flight, if you must.


Openrocket simulation settings to emulate actual launch site:
