    "# Parametric Liquid Engine Maker for OpenRocket\n",
    "This is adapted from a script created by natronics, 7deeptide, and jalouke to create engine files for OpenRocket. Its original purpose was to determine some crucial properties of the engine system based on initial assumptions and specifications a few years before the multidisciplinary design optimization for LV4 began.\n",
    "\n",
    "It has since been reformed to take its parameters from the optimization in order to utilize OpenRocket as a downstream verifier of potential designs, since the optimizer's internal model of aerodynamics is particularly low-fidelity. In addition, since this script is imported by our trajectory model and optimizer, we may define certain functions, variables, and parameters in one location. This eliminates redundancy and makes our lives easier if we would like to change any of our parameters based on improved assumptions or information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assumptions\n",
    "* Using OpenRocket is the correct way to decide whether a given design is viable.\n",
    "* The upstream process that determines our variables does not provide garbage.\n",
    "* There is already a corresponding rocket file that is appropriately matched to the engine file we create.\n",
    "* Oxygen/Fuel ratio is 1.3 to 1.\n",
    "    * This has been determined using CEArun, based on our assumptions (found in optimization notebook) about chamber thermodynamics.\n",
    "* 10% of tank length should be added to account for ullage (tanks not filling to ideal capacity).\n",
    "* Factor of safety for tank stress is 2.\n",
    "* Mass fudge factor for system components is 2.\n",
    "* Gaps between subsystems are 0.05 meters.\n",
    "* Oxygen tank is aluminum and fuel tank is carbon-fiber.\n",
    "* Mass of EFS is 10 kg and includes plumbing.\n",
    "* Mass of EMS is 1 kg.\n",
    "* Mass of LFE is 3 kg.\n",
    "* Length of EFS subsystem is 18 in.\n",
    "* Length of EMS subsystem is 4 in.\n",
    "* Length of LFE subsystem is 0.3 meters.\n",
    "* Distance between interior of airframe and exterior of a tank is 0.007 meters (measured from LV3).\n",
    "* Tank pressure is ~100 PSI, and is pressurized by an N2 tank and ramped up by the EFS prior to injection.\n",
    "* Bulkheads (in gaps between subsystems) are 0.25 in thick, cylindrical, aluminum, and 60% empty space.\n",
    "* The differences of vectors of burn times, thrust values, and altitudes between OpenRocket and the trajectory simulation that generates OpenRocket's engine file are negligible.\n",
    "    * Both models have the same burn times.\n",
    "    * Both models have the same thrust curves with respect to time.\n",
    "    * Thrust at a time is actually a function of altitude at that time.\n",
    "    * Altitudes differ between the two models to an extent determined by time step and fidelity of numerical integration.\n",
    "        * For the fast Runge-Kutta with $\\Delta t = 0.25$, our integration results in a peak altitude ~1-3 km below OpenRocket.\n",
    "        * For the medium Runge-Kutta with the same time step, our peak altitude has been no more than 200 m of OpenRocket, but this increased accuracy is no longer conservative and much slower to compute, so we continue to use the low-fidelity trajectory.\n",
    "        * A final caveat is that a rigorous analysis of our trajectory model is still incomplete."

    "\n",
    "To be clear, *tank_thickness* is engineering black magic and beyond my understanding. I have changed it to account for a different tank pressure than the original MDO assumed. Nowhere do we account for the difference in volume that the inner radius entails, but this is hopefully a small change that is absorbed by the assumptions regarding ullage and factors of safety. It would be relatively trivial to account for that difference explicitly in *split_tanks* if we did some elementary arithmetic. If someone asks politely, I'll do it. *tank_mass* is more engineering black magic but straight-forward; its just a uniformly dense thicc cylinder with lids, and the estimate is doubled for good pessimism.\n",
